\section{\textsf{Intro to Matrices}}
In mathematics, a matrix (plural: matrices) is a grid of elements. You can think of a matrix as being like a 2D array. For example:

\begin{equation*}
    \begin{pmatrix}
    2 & 1\\
    0 & 3
    \end{pmatrix}
\end{equation*}

Just like vectors, matrices can be of any size, but only sizes from 1 to 4 are used. Matrices are named based on their dimensions; a matrix that is 3 elements wide and 2 elements tall would be a 3x2 matrix. In computing, when the height and width are the same, it is common to abbreviate it to just the one number; a 4x4 matrix is just called a mat4 in GLM.

You can create a matrix in GLM as follows:

\begin{figure}[ht]

    \colorbox{backgroundcolor}{
        \parbox{0.9\textwidth}{
            \lstinputlisting[language=csh,style=csharp]
            {code/chap2_MathematicsPrinciples/CreatingAMatrix.cpp}
        }
    }

\end{figure}

Matrices are very important for graphics programming; matrices are how you can move around your polygons without having to replace their vertices. Scaling, translation, and rotation are all accomplished using matrices.

\subsection{\textsf{Row Major vs Column Major}}
Before you can learn anything about matrices, you need to understand matrix ordering.

There is some debate as to how matrices should be laid out in memory. Matrices are made up of rows (horizontal) and columns (vertical). There are two different ways a matrix can be laid out: row-major, and column-major.

In row-major, the index progresses from left to right, dropping down to the next row after reaching the end. In column-major matrices, the index progresses from top to bottom, moving right to the next column after reaching the end. To demonstrate:

\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{images/chap2/RowVsColumn.png}
    \caption{Row-major vs column-major matrix ordering}
    \label{fig:row_vs_column}
\end{figure}

In this example, if you looked at the fifth element, you'd see 6 if you were using row-major, or 2 if you're using column major.

GLM uses row-major for all operations, so this book will as well. \emph{If you run into unexpected behavior while using matrices, it could be because you're using column-major instead}.

Luckily, converting between row-major and column-major (and vice-versa) is very simple. The process is known as \emph{transposing}. If you get incorrect results from a matrix operation, transposing should be your first debugging step. You can transpose a matrix in GLM as follows:

\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \colorbox{backgroundcolor}{
        \parbox{0.9\textwidth}{
            \lstinputlisting[language=csh,style=csharp]
            {code/chap2_MathematicsPrinciples/TransposingAMatrix.cpp}
        }
    }

\end{figure}

\subsection{\textsf{Matrix addition and subtraction}}
Like vectors, matrix addition and subtraction are both done component-wise:

\begin{equation*}
    \begin{pmatrix}
    2 & 1\\
    0 & 3
    \end{pmatrix} +\begin{pmatrix}
    8 & 7\\
    4 & 9
    \end{pmatrix} =\begin{pmatrix}
    2+8 & 1+8\\
    0+4 & 3+9
    \end{pmatrix} =\begin{pmatrix}
    10 & 9\\
    4 & 12
    \end{pmatrix}
\end{equation*}

Scalar operations also still work the same way:

\begin{equation*}
    \begin{pmatrix}
    2 & 1\\
    0 & 3
    \end{pmatrix} +7=\begin{pmatrix}
    2+7 & 1+7\\
    0+7 & 3+7
    \end{pmatrix} =\begin{pmatrix}
    9 & 8\\
    7 & 10
    \end{pmatrix}
\end{equation*}

\subsection{\textsf{Matrix multiplication}}
Matrices can be multiplied by a scalar the same way vectors can:

\begin{equation*}
    \begin{pmatrix}
    2 & 1\\
    0 & 3
    \end{pmatrix} \times 3=\begin{pmatrix}
    2\times 3 & 1\times 3\\
    0\times 3 & 3\times 3
    \end{pmatrix} =\begin{pmatrix}
    6 & 3\\
    0 & 9
    \end{pmatrix}
\end{equation*}

Multiplication with a vector or another matrix is where matrices become more difficult, but also more useful. Like with vectors, component-wise matrix multiplication isn't possible. Unlike vectors, the dot product and cross product are not defined for matrices.
