Dylan Perks, Tyler Crandall, and Vivian Jones wrote this book under the Ultz umbrella, with the generous help of an assortment of passionate community contributors.

This book will use C++, but it will be written as loosely as possible to allow readers looking to use Vulkan in other languages to rewrite the snippets without significant difficulty. We have excluded typical C++ boilerplate such as headers, which you must provide yourself. The full C++ source is available in our GitHub repository. We recommend having an intermediate understanding of how C++ works before continuing.

If you're reading this in one of the finished copies we distribute, thank you so much for supporting us! If you're just reading this on GitHub, then please consider supporting the authors of this book by buying an official copy. We only charge a minor price - cheaper than most other Vulkan books available, in fact.
